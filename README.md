# Image_Format_Converter
## PIL Package
PIL (Python Imaging Library) adds image processing capabilities to python interpreter. The image will be broken into RGB pixels which categorizes the each pixel color definition. However, the color definition of each format of an image changes according to the vetor density of that format. Hence, we have to convert the certain formats of an image according to the adjustments of their RGB function. 

There are different formats of Images for instance,
1. JPEG or JPG
2. PNG
3. TIFF
4. AVIF 
5. APNG
6. GIF
7. SVG
8. BMP
9. WebP

The PIL Library is capable of processing image according to their RGB ratio. Hence, the source code can change the bulk of image datasets from one format to another format.
